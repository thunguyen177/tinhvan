"You fool! Why did you pull me into this?" asked Mai. <br> 
"I didn't mean to, I was just trying to grab something so that I wouldn't be pulled inside!" Parker said, angrily, but at the 
same time, he felt guilty, because no matter what, he was the one who pull Mai along. <br> 
Mai didn't look at him. She tried to summon her wand, but the wand does not seem to appear. Now, she was panic. However, a great 
wizard like can use magic without a wand. Therefore, she tried to see if she could still use magic at all by trying to make the buds 
in front of her to blossom. But they didn't blossom. Her face pale. <br> 
"Somebody uses magic to trap us into this book", Mai said, "I can barely any magic at all! I can not even summon my wand." <br>
"What are we gonna do? Do you of any spell that can help us get out?", Parker inquires in panic. <br>
"I can not use my magic!" Yelled Mai. <br> 
Parker didn't say anything. He knew that Mai was so desparated that she didn't even bother to give him bad remarks like she 
usually does. So, both of them kept silent for a long while. <br> 
"You really don't know a way of getting us out of here?" asked Parker. <br> 
"No. I have no idea how to get out, and how the time passes here compared to our world!", Mai replied in a chill voice, "Besides,
isn't this your favorite novel? I guess you may like to stay here for a while". <br> 
"Haizz," Parker. "Guess she is really mad at me this time," thought Parker.
