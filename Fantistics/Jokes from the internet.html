	<li> Two statisticians were traveling in an airplane from LA to New York.
About an hour into the flight, the pilot announced that they had lost
an engine, but don’t worry, there are three left. However, instead of 5
hours it would take 7 hours to get to New York. A little later, he
announced that a second engine failed, and they still had two left,
but it would take 10 hours to get to New York. Somewhat later, the
pilot again came on the intercom and announced that a third engine
had died. Never fear, he announced, because the plane could fly on a
single engine. However, it would now take 18 hours to get to New
York. At this point, one statistician turned to the other and said, “Gee, I
hope we don’t lose that last engine, or we’ll be up here forever!”  <br> 
	<li> When a statistician is pounding a nail with a hammer but misses the
nail and hits his thumb, what do we call it? Sampling Error <br> 
	<li> When a statistician is pounding a nail with a hammer but misses the
nail and hits his thumb 10 CONSECUTIVE times, what do we call it?
A Biased Statistic <br> 
	<li> How to avoid traffic accidents?
There was this statistics professor who, when driving his car, would
always accelerate hard before coming to any Intersection, whip
straight through it , then slow down again once he’d got past it. One
day, he took a passenger, who was understandably unnerved by his
driving style, and asked him why he went so fast over intersections.
The statistics professor replied, “Well, statistically speaking, you are
far more likely to have an accident at an intersection, so I just make
sure that I spend less time there.” <br> 
	<li> A patient asked his surgeon what the odds were of him surviving an
impending operation. The doctor replied they were 50/50 but he’d
be all right because the first fifty had already died!!
	<li> We are “mean” lovers.	
	<li>We are right 95% of the time.
	<li> We may not be normal but we are transformable.
	<li> We need assumptions all the time!
There were a physicist, a circus strong man, and a statistician
marooned on a desert island. A box of canned food washes ashore,
and the question is how to open the cans. The physicist suggests
dropping them from the trees so that they break open. The strong
man says that’s too messy. Instead, he will rip the cans open with his
bare hands. The statistician says that’s still too messy, but he knows
how to open the cans without making a mess. “First,” he says
“assume we have a can opener.”
