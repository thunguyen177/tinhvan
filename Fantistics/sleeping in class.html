   <h3>1.Captain of sleeping in class team </h3>
   <p>
Mai opened her eyes wider and then let it come back to normal when she saw the boy
   sitting in the armchair. Then she knew that she was about to tutor for Parker, a boy who
   has officially entitled "captain of sleeping in class team" thanks to Dr.Anderlecht's
   statistics course. <br>
Yes, that course!  It's that STATISTICS course that Parker would never forgive!
   The first time he fell asleep, the professor was giving an example for the class.
   Dr. Anderlecht utilized his magic to call in some mosquitoes from the field to make
   the lecture more attractive. Yet, when he looked down, a student was sleeping in class!
   Left hand under his cheek, half-closed eyes (there was some rumor that he even snored)!
   This made the professor a bit mad, but he still kept his calm outside. After finishing
   the example, the professor sent the mosquitoes back to the field, except one was sent
   directly to that student. And "Aw!", screamed the student after being bitten by a giant
   mosquito. All the students busted in laughs. <br>
As shameful as it may sound, it was not enough to keep Parker awake in Dr.Anderlecht's
   course more than two classes.  Three classes later, he fell asleep again. This time,
   instead of sending some bug to bite him, Dr. Anderlecht said very gently in front of the
   class: "The red hair student who sat behind the one that is sleeping, could you come up here
   and show everyone how you solve this problem?" <br>
These two stories soon reached Parker's parents' ears. That is why Mai was there, in the
   living room of Parker's house, being introduced to the student to whom she's gonna tutor.
<br>
"Hello, my name is Parker! What's your name?" asked Parker, struck by Mai's beauty.<br>
"My name is Mai!" said Mai.<br>
 Confused by Mai's reply, Parker asked again: "Oh, I know your name is yours, but
   what is your name?"<br>
"My name is Mai, M-A-I!"
<br> "Oh, I see! Sorry! I thought you said, "My name is MINE"!"
<br> "That's fine, let's get start!" Mai said, in a chill voice.
   She got used with her name confused with "my, mine" or anything like that! There are more
   "mistreated" Vietnamese names. Le Hong Truc, for example. "Le" is pretty close to "Lee"
   in Korean. "Truc" is pretty close to "Truck." So, many people just thought it is read as
   "Lee Hong Truck"! But who would name their baby girl "a truck"? <br>
"Start what?" amazed Parker. <br>
"The tutoring session!" said Mai. <br>
 "Oh! Okay!" <br>
