<h3> The imbalanced data problem </h3>

The AI Institute's research campus' apartment resident site...
<br> 
All of the foreign students went outside to explore the city, leaving a bunch of Vietnamese here, inside the kitchen, finished their dinner.
<br> 
Duong blushed, "Why should we care about such an <b>extreme event</b> instead of the things that lie at the <b>center region of normal distribution</b>? For example, who are gonna clear the table and wash the dishes?" &#128580
<br> 
"Well,  extreme events are usually interesting, and have many applications," Quang, the postdoc researcher said, as serious as if he was giving a lecture.
<br> 
"For example?" asked Duong.
<br> 
"Like the bank can freeze a user's account when detecting irregular transactions, predicting storms, avalanches, tsunamis, epidemic, etc.," Quang said again.
<br> 
Before Duong could open her mouth again, Duy teased her, adding some words, "And how some people can help us getting a girlfriend or boyfriend quickly."
<br> 
"You're good at speaking, so I think that's easy for you. Just pick one and pursuit her!" Thanh said.
<br> 
"What if she runs away? Having a girlfriend is an optimization problem, 
of which the maximum of the loss function is a broken heart." Duy replied.
<br> 
"Well, you should minimize the loss, not to maximize it," Duong said,
<br> 
"In the past, I trained neural networks, and the loss exploded many times. 
So, I guess similar things may happen when I try to pursue a girl." Quang said, 
with a lot of honesty &#128580
<br> 
Everyone laughed again. &#128514
<br> 
"Then you use <b>gradient clipping </b>, coddle her, give her gifts when she seems indifferent to you." Duong couldn't hold her laughter. "By the way, it's not my turn to wash the dishes today. So, I'm gonna go back to my room and train my own network." Then, she left.
<br> 
"I wonder, which loss function should we use for this problem?" Duy asked.
<br> 
"Binary cross-entropy, of course!" Tuan smiled. "Suppose the output from a girl \(z\) is 1 if she likes you and 0 if she doesn't, and the probability that she likes you is \(p\). Then the <b> binary cross-entropy </b> is defined as
$$z\log p + (1-z)\log (1-p),$$
which implies that if she likes you, then \(z=1\) and loss is \(log p\). If she doesn't, then \(z=0\) and loss is \(log (1-p)\).
<br> 
That's for one girl. If you decide to pursuit \(n\) girls at the same time, then the loss is

$$\sum_{i=1}^n (z_i\log p + (1-z_i)\log (1-p)),"$$
<br> 
"Oh my god! Now I see who you really are. You pursuit \(n\) girls at the same time!" Quynh went ha ha ha ...
<br> 
"Oh, no! For me, \(n=1\) for sure. Yet, I was afraid that he couldn't have a wife when he is too old. So, I thought that he may be interested in pursuing \(n\) girls at the same time." 
<br> 
"Who is older?" Duy rolled his eyes. &#128548
<br> 
"Of course, me!" Tuan replied. Then, he tried to move on to another problem immediately. 
"Let's talk about how to tackle this problem."
<br> 
"Isn't this an imbalanced data problem?" Quynh grinned.
<br> 
"Yes, of course, I mostly succeeded in pursuing girls. 
So this is really a very imbalanced data issue." Tuan quickly replied before Quynh could 
continue by saying that he failed to pursuit girls most of the time &#128518.
