    "Yes! We just throw arbitrary things that are available in the fridge into a pot. This is a real world `mixture model`, which can be used for both classification and clustering. After the pot has boiled for about 15 minutes, the proteins from meat/bones/fishes start to cluster on the surface. Even though `expectation maximization` is a common procedure for estimating parameters in this model but I must admit that the expectation that I got for my dishes are usually minimal! "
