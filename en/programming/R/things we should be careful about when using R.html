<h2>Things we should be careful about when using R</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Understanding the command</li>
    <li><i>Is the packages works well together?</i> If not, we should detach one package before loading
another. For example, "nlme" does not work really well with "lmer". Therefore, before loading lmer,
we should enter "detach(nlme)" to detach package nlme.<br></li>
    <li>Different packages have functions of the same name</li>
    <li>Not using factor: The function factor is used to encode a vector as a category.
        If we forgot to factor the ones that we need then R will analyze these variables as
        if they are continous variables, which can results in wrong analysis.
        If the input of one column are characters then R can automatically reallize that's factor.
        But this may not happen if the categorical input is encoded by number. <br>
        To check if a column has been factored yet, use <pre>is.factor()</pre>.<br>
        To factorize, use <pre>as.factor() </pre>
        In general, one can check the structure of a data set by using <pre>str()</pre></li>
