Guides and resources

Which word list
should I learn first?

My suggestion is that you should learn Magoosh’s word list
first, then come <a href="http://www.graduateshotline.com/gre-word-list.html">
Graduate hotline’s</a> word list, Kaplan’s wordlist,Manhattan’s word list. Barron’s
word list has too many words. Many of those words are not common in the test.
Don’t waste time to study Barron’s word list.
<a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="more"></a><br />
<br />

Although most of the word lists is said by their creators “these
are the … most important/basic/… word”, I don’t think that’s true! In most of
the word lists, I can find “not really important” words. How to judge that?
Just do practice tests, questions and read “The Atlantic, CNN, etc”.


<br />
In this page, we follow the above suggestion to create poems
for you to learn English. When creating poems at this blogspot, I dismiss the
words that I find unimportant or place them in the advanced word lists. I also give
some notes on confusing words to help you learn better. Thus, don’t
forget to study my <a href="http://englishwithpic.blogspot.com/search/label/GRE%20confusing%20words" target="_blank">
commonly mistaken word list</a>! You will find it
very useful!
<br />


After learning basic wordlists, don’t forget to do practice
questions. GRE verbal questions is all about choices and vocabularies.





<br />
If you have to prepare for not only the GRE test but also the &nbsp;TOEFL/IELTS, then you should learn TOEFL/IELTS
vocabularies before learning GRE vocabularies. The reason is &nbsp;TOEFL/IELTS vocabularies are at the high school level,
SAT vocabularies are at the university's level, GRE vocabularies are at the graduate school level.&nbsp;

After registering for Kaplan, you can take a free full-length practice test. This
test is easier than a real test. However, it’s worth to try.<br />



<a href="https://www.manhattanprep.com/gre/resources/">https://www.manhattanprep.com/gre/resources/</a>:
Manhattan’s free practice test is a little more difficult than the official
tests. So, you should do this test after taking Kaplan’s free test.
