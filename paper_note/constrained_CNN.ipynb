    "In this paper, the authors propose a loss function to optimize convolutional neural networks with abitrary linear constraints on the structured output space of pixel labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\overrightarrow{Q}$ be the vectorized softmax output. The Constrained CNN (CCNN) optimization problem can be formulated as:       \n",
    "   <font color=\"red\"> Find $\\theta$ such that $A_I\\overrightarrow{Q}\\ge \\overrightarrow{b}_I \\forall I$ </font> \n",
    "        \n",
    "where $A_I \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k\\times nm}, \\overrightarrow{b}_I\\in \\mathbb{R} ^k$ enforce $k$ individual linear constraints on the output distribution of the networks on image $I$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is generally not convex with respect to the network parameters. To optimize the above problem, the authors introduce a latent probability distribution `P(X)` over the semantic labels `X`. They constrain $P(X)$ to lie in the feasibility region of the constrained objective while removing the constraints on the network output `Q`. After that, they encourage P and Q to \n",
    "model the same probability distribution by minimizing their KL-divergence. This result in a new problem that is much easier to optimize: <font color=\"red\"> $\\min_{\\theta,P} D(P(X)||Q(X|\\theta))$ such that $A\\overrightarrow{P}\\ge \\overrightarrow{b}, \\sum_XP(X)=1$, </font> where $D(P(X)||Q(X|\\theta)) =  \\sum_XP(X)\\log P(X)-\\mathbb{E}[\\log Q(X|\\theta)]$ and $\\overrightarrow{P}$ is the vectorized version of $P(X)$.\n",

    "We can also relax the problem by adding a slack variable $\\xi$ like in SVM. Details of this and the optimization process are in the papers.\n",
