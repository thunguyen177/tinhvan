Here are several things I learned from graduate school:
There is no course on how to write a research paper, how to do research. Most of the
advisor automatically assumed you knew a lot about doing research already. So, you
need to prepared for your self. A good book on writing for computer science students is
<font color="red"> writing for computer science </font> by Justin Zobel. In addition, below are 
some notes on writing and doing research:
<ul>
	<li> When trying to modify a table, some gigantic equations, remember to keep the older 
version by copying that part to some other file or comment it out in Latex (command 'Ctrl + /' in 
Overleaf). If someone ask you to modify it, and you are not sure what that person want, draw a 
sketch of it and send it to that person to make sure of what you're doing, avoid your effort
going to be a waste.
	<li> When submitting to a journal, you may want to check out, aside from guidelines that 
the journal/conference provides, you may want to go to google scholar to check out how recent 
papers from that journal/conference is written.
	<li> Overleaf issue: Overleaf often display the pdf file even if there arer errors. 
Therefore, check before submitting to journal
	<li> Not every journal/conference allows using extra packages. Avoid being rejected 
because of this!
	<li> Instead of downloading and processing data for your experiments from scratch,
google some examples/tutorial that use the same dataset if possible. That's faster!
<ul>
