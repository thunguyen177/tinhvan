<h2>R tips and tricks:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Clear the environment/old data when re-analyze the data.
        Moreover, if you are about to work with a big data set, clearing the environment might help R run faster in its impending sessions.

  <li>Use R cheat sheet: There is no need to remember a bunch of commands.
    You can get access R cheat sheet directly from RStudio by the option "Help >> Cheatsheet".

<li>Use understandable notations: it’s might be easier for other people to read and for you to re-read your code if you use notations that is close to the

    <p>Ex: If I have to compute $\mathbf{E}(ln(Z))$ where Z is a random variable,
        then, in R, I would prefer using notation $ElnZ$ instead of some $u,v$, so that I
        immediately know what is that for without having to read any further comment.
</p>

 <li>Write comments so that you know what you did if you have to reread in the future.

    <hr color = "#F333FF" width="400px">
    <li> Learn from source code:
     to read source code in R, type " the name" (THE NAME ONLY) of the function. For example:
<pre>
    > ks.test
function (x, y, ..., alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
    exact = NULL)
{
    alternative <- match.arg(alternative)
    DNAME <- deparse(substitute(x))....
</pre>

Some other ways are to type:
<pre>
    View(ks.test)
    functionBody(ks.test)
</pre>

</li>
<hr color = "#F333FF" width="400px">
<li>Use vectors and already defined functions instead of loops
For example (Example from R help)

<pre>
    ## Compute row and column sums for a matrix:

x <- cbind(x1 = 3, x2 = c(4:1, 2:5))

dimnames(x)[[1]] <- letters[1:8]

apply(x, 2, mean, trim = .2)

col.sums <- apply(x, 2, sum)

row.sums <- apply(x, 1, sum)
</pre>

 Fundamental functions you should know are apply, lapply, etc.

<p>Ex: I have values: $r_1,…, r_n$, and I want to generate numbers $W_i \sim \chi_2^2/{r_i}, i=1,…,n$ then instead of using a long loop, I’m just gonna use:
</p>
<pre>
    > r = 1:5

> w = lapply(r,function(u){return(rchisq(1,2*u-2)/2)})

> w = unlist(w)

> w

[1] 0.0000000 0.6211988 0.7875775 2.8056619 2.8979872
</pre>


This is just a simple example, but you will find it very useful in more complicated cases.
<li> Note that if we have two vector

<pre>
    > u

[1] 5 6 7 8 9

> v

[1] 1 2 3 4 5
</pre>

then u*v would return pairwise product, and u %*% v would return dot product of two vectors;

<pre>> u * v

[1] 5 12 21 32 45

> u %*% v

[,1] [1,] 115
</pre>


This is simple but can be really useful sometimes.

<li> Write reproducible codes

For example, if you have this problem:

Giambra and Quilter (1989) performed a study to investigate gender and age difference in
    ability to sustain attention when given Mackworth’s clock-test. This clock is metal with
    a plain white face and a black pointer that moves around the face in 100 discrete steps of
    368 each. During the test period, the pointer made 23 double jumps, defined as moving twice
    the normal distance or 7.28 in the same time period, at random and irregular intervals.
    Subjects were told that double jumps would occur and asked to signal their recognition of
    occurrence by pressing a button. Scores were the number of correct recognitions of the
    double jumps. The scores below are for 10 men aged 18–29 and 10 men aged 50–59. Determine
    whether the median number of correct scores is larger for young men than for older men.

<pre>
    Age 18–29: 11 13 15 15 17 19 20 21 21 22

    Age 50–59: 8 9 10 11 12 13 5 17 19 23
</pre>

and I want to use the median test for this problem. Then, instead of writing:
<pre>

young = c(11,13,15,15,17,19,20,21,21,22)

old = c(8,9,10,11,12,13,5,17,19,23)

m = length(young); n = length(old); N = m+n

z = c(young, old); z_sorted = sort(z)

med = (z[N/2]+z[N/2+1])/2

U = sum(young<med)

U_plus_V = sum(z<med)

pval = phyper(U,m,n,U_plus_V)

> pval

[1] 0.03488926

</pre>
I would write a function so that I can reuse in the future

 <pre>
      med.test <- function(x,y){

m = length(x), n= length(y); N=m+nz= c(x,y);

z_sorted = sort(z)med = (z[N/2]+z[N/2+1])/2

U = sum(x < med) U_plus_V = sum(z < med)

pval = phyper(U,m,n,U_plus_V)

return(pval)

}

med.test(young, old)
 </pre>
