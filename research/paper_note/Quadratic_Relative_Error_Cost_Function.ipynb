    "In this paper, the authors investigate the performance of neural networks when Quadratic Relative Error Cost Function is used vs when mean square error (MSE) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the paper, the MSE is defined as $$C = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_i^m(y_{oi}-y_i)^2/2,$$ where $M$ is the number of samples, $y_{oi}$ is the output of the $i^{th}$ sample from the neural network, $y_i$ is the target value of the $i^{th}$ samples. \n",

    "The Quadratic Relative Error Cost Function (REMSE) is defined as $$C = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_i^m(\\frac{y_{oi}-y_i}{y_i})^2/2,$$\n",

    "\"A neural network\n",
    "using the REMSE cost function generally gains acceleration\n",
    "that is A (A is larger than 1) times that gained by a network\n",

    "\"If the target dataset contains\n",
