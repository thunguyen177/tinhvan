<h2>Truyện ngụ ngôn xứ Baltimore</h2>
Here’s a parable. One day, you receive an unsolicited newsletter from a
stockbroker in Baltimore, containing a tip that a certain stock is due for a big
rise. A week passes, and just as the Baltimore stockbroker predicted, the
stock goes up. The next week, you get a new edition of the newsletter, and this
time, the tip is about a stock whose price the broker thinks is going to fall.
And indeed, the stock craters. Ten weeks go by, each one bringing a new issue
of the mysterious newsletter with a new prediction, and each time, the
prediction comes true.
On the eleventh week, you get a solicitation to invest money with the
Baltimore stockbroker, naturally with a hefty commission to cover the keen
view of the market so amply demonstrated by the newsletter’s ten-week run of
golden picks.
Sounds like a pretty good deal, right? Surely the Baltimore stockbroker is
onto something—it seems incredibly unlikely that a complete duffer, with no
special knowledge about the market, would get ten up-or-down predictions in
a row correct. In fact, you can compute the odds on the nose: if the duffer has
a 50% chance of getting each prediction right, then the chance of his getting
the first two predictions right is half of half, or a quarter, his chance of getting
the first three right is half of that quarter, or an eighth, and so on. Continuing
this computation, his chance of hitting the mark ten times in a row* is
(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2)
× (1/2) × (1/2) = (1/1024).
